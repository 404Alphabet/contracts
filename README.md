# 404 Alphabet Contracts

**Repository for 404 contracts (token, utils, libraries, etc.)**

### Getting Started

-   Use Foundry:

```bash
forge install
forge test
```

-   Use Hardhat:

```bash
npm install
npx hardhat test
```

### Features

-   Write / run tests with either Hardhat or Foundry:

```bash
forge test
#Â or
npx hardhat test
```

-   Use Hardhat's task framework

```bash
npx hardhat example
```

-   Install libraries with Foundry which work with Hardhat.

```bash
forge install rari-capital/solmate # Already in this repo, just an example
```

### Notes

Whenever you install new libraries using Foundry, make sure to update your `remappings.txt` file by running `forge remappings > remappings.txt`. This is required because we use `hardhat-preprocessor` and the `remappings.txt` file to allow Hardhat to resolve libraries you install with Foundry.
